In the digital age, money starts to feel like 0s and 1s, and spending is as easy as a swipe or a tap. Plutus is my solution: a web app for tracking expenses while sticking to a budget.

- Add detailed entries for each purchase
- Categorize expenses according to your budget
- OCR feature reads and interprets information from a receipt
- Analytics about monthly spending
- Access to your account and data from any device you log into

## Tools
- Next.js
- Firebase
- Gemini API

## Reflection
I had to learn a variety of new tools and systems for this project. This was my first time fully implementing Firebase and an LLM API, and it took a lot of work to make sure data was properly cleaned and synchronized. I'm looking forward to exploring databases further in future projects!
